# PassMan NextGen - Architectural Overview

## Introduction
PassMan NextGen is a modern, secure password management application built with a microservices architecture using containers. The application consists of three main components: Frontend Container, Backend Container, and Database Container, each serving a specific purpose and communicating through well-defined interfaces.

## System Architecture

### 1. Frontend Container
The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, providing a modern and type-safe user interface.

#### Key Components:
- **Technology Stack**:
  - React 18+ with TypeScript
  - Material-UI (MUI) for component styling
  - Zustand for state management
  - React Query for data fetching and caching
  - Vite as the build tool and development server

#### Core Features:
1. **Authentication Interface**:
   - Login page (`Login.tsx`)
   - Registration page (`Register.tsx`)
   - Protected route handling in `App.tsx`

2. **Password Management Interface**:
   - Dashboard (`Dashboard.tsx`) for password list view
   - Password Dialog (`PasswordDialog.tsx`) for creating/editing passwords
   - Layout component (`Layout.tsx`) for consistent UI structure

3. **State Management**:
   - Authentication state managed by Zustand (`authStore.ts`)
   - Password data cached using React Query
   - Type-safe API interactions using generated OpenAPI clients

4. **Development Features**:
   - Mock API service (`mockData.ts`) for development
   - Proxy configuration for API requests
   - Hot module replacement
   - TypeScript strict mode enabled

### 2. Backend Container
The backend is powered by FastAPI, providing a high-performance, async API server.

#### Key Components:
- **Technology Stack**:
  - FastAPI framework
  - SQLAlchemy for ORM
  - Alembic for database migrations
  - Pydantic for data validation
  - JWT for authentication

#### Core Features:
1. **Authentication System**:
   - User registration and login endpoints
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Password hashing and verification

2. **Password Management**:
   - CRUD operations for password entries
   - Encryption/decryption of sensitive data
   - User-specific password isolation

3. **Database Models**:
   - User model with authentication details
   - Password entry model with encrypted data
   - Relationship management between users and passwords

4. **Security Features**:
   - Cryptographic operations for password data
   - Rate limiting
   - CORS configuration
   - Input validation and sanitization

### 3. Database Container
The application uses a SQL database (SQLite in development, PostgreSQL in production) for data persistence.

#### Key Features:
1. **Schema Design**:
   - Users table for authentication data
   - Passwords table for encrypted password entries
   - Foreign key relationships for data integrity

2. **Migration System**:
   - Version-controlled schema changes
   - Automated migration scripts
   - Rollback capability

## Communication Flow

1. **Frontend to Backend Communication**:
   - RESTful API calls using Axios
   - Authentication via JWT tokens
   - Request/response validation using TypeScript types
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Backend to Database Communication**:
   - Async database operations using SQLAlchemy
   - Connection pooling for performance
   - Transaction management
   - Error handling and rollback capabilities

## Security Measures

1. **Frontend Security**:
   - Secure storage of JWT tokens
   - XSS prevention
   - CSRF protection
   - Input validation

2. **Backend Security**:
   - Password hashing using strong algorithms
   - Encryption of sensitive data
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization

3. **Database Security**:
   - Encrypted password storage
   - User isolation
   - Secure connection handling

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   - Frontend dev server on port 3000
   - Backend API server on port 8000
   - Hot reload for both frontend and backend
   - Mock data support for frontend development

2. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end testing capabilities

3. **Deployment**:
   - Docker containers for each component
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Database migration handling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Planned Features**:
   - Password sharing capabilities
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Password strength analysis
   - Audit logging
   - Backup and restore functionality

2. **Technical Improvements**:
   - GraphQL API support
   - Real-time updates using WebSockets
   - Enhanced encryption options
   - Performance optimizations

## Conclusion
PassMan NextGen demonstrates a modern, secure approach to password management, leveraging contemporary technologies and best practices in software development. The containerized architecture ensures scalability and maintainability, while the chosen technology stack provides a robust foundation for future enhancements.
